| Step | Description | Link

| 1
| Identify the coordinate and auxillary coordinate variables for which tie point and interpolation variables are required.
| 

| 2
| Identify non-overlapping subsets of the coordinate variables to be interpolated by the same interpolation method. For each coordinate variable subset, create an interpolation variable and specify the selected interpolation method using the **`interpolation_name`** attribute of the interpolation variable. 
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-interpolation-variable>>

| 3
| For each coordinate variable subset, add the coordinates variable subset and the corresponding interpolation variable to the the **`tie_points`** attribute of the data variable. 
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-points-attribute>>


| 4
| For each coordinate variable subset, identify the set of interpolation dimensions and the set of non-interpolation dimensions.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-dimensions>>

| 5
| For each set of the interpolation dimensions, identify the interpolation areas and select the interpolation zones and the tie points, taking into account the required coordinate reconstitution accuracy when selecting the density of tie points.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-points>>

| 6
| For each of the interpolation dimensions, add the interpolation dimension, the corresponding tie point interpolation dimension and, if required by the selected interpolation method, its corresponding interpolation zone dimension to the **`tie_point_dimensions`** attribute of the data variable.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-point-dimensions-attribute>>

| 7
| For each of the interpolation dimensions, record the location of each identified tie point in a tie point index variable. For each interpolation dimension, add the interpolation dimension and its tie point index variable to the **`tie_point_indices`** attribute of the data variable.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-point-indices>>

| 8
| For each of the target coordinate and auxillary coordinate variables, create the corresponding tie point coordinate variable and copy the coordinate values from the target domain coordinate variables to the tie point variables for the target domain indices identified by the tie point index variable. Repeat this step for each combination of indices of the non-interpolation dimensions.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-point-indices>>

| 9
| For each of the target coordinate and auxillary coordinate variable having a **`bounds`** attribute, add the **`bounds`** attribute to the tie point coordinate variable, create the tie point bounds variable and copy the bounds values from the target domain bounds variable to the tie point bounds variable for the target domain indices identified by the tie point index variable. Repeat this step for each combination of indices of the non-interpolation dimensions.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-bounds>>

| 10
| Finally, if required by the selected interpolation method, follow the steps defined for the method in Appendix J to create any required interpolation coefficients variables and interpolation configuration variables. As relevant, create the  **`interpolation_coefficients`** and **`interpolation_configuration`** attributes and populate them with the interpolation coefficients variables and interpolation configuration variables respectively.

| 1
| From the **`tie_points`** attribute of the data variable, identify the coordinate and auxillary coordinate variable subsets for which tie point interpolation is required.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-points-attribute>>

| 2
| For each coordinate variable subset, identify the set of dimension. Using the **`tie_point_dimensions`** attribute of the data variable, identify the set of interpolation dimensions and the set of non-interpolation dimensions.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-dimensions>>

<<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-point-dimensions-attribute>>

| 3
| From the **`tie_point_dimensions`** attribute of the data variable, identify for each of the interpolation dimensions the corresponding tie point interpolation dimension and, if defined, the corresponding interpolation zone dimension.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-point-dimensions-attribute>>

| 4
| From the tie point index variables referenced in the **`tie_point_indices`** attribute of the data variable, identify the location of the tie points in the corresponding interpolation dimension.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-point-indices>>

| 5
| For each of the interpolation dimensions, identify pairs of adjacent indices in the tie point index variable with index values differing by more than one, each index pair defining the extend of an interpolation zone in that dimension. A full interpolation zone is defined by one such index pair per interpolation dimension, with combinations of one index from each pair defining the interpolation zone tie points.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-points>>

| 6
| From the **`tie_points`** attribute of the data variable, identify the interpolation variable for the coordinate and auxillary coordinate variable subset. From the **`interpolation_name`** attribute of the interpolation variable, identify the interpolation method. 
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-interpolation-variable>>

| 7
| As required by the selected interpolation method, identify the interpolation coefficients variables and interpolation configuration variables from the interpolation variable **`interpolation_coefficients`** and **`interpolation_configuration`** attributes respectively.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-interpolation-variable>>

| 8
| For each of the tie point coordinate and auxillary coordinate variables, create the corresponding target coordinate variable. For each interpolation zone, apply the interpolation method to reconstitute the target domain coordinate values and store these in the target domain coordinate variables. Repeat this step for each combination of indices of the non-interpolation dimensions.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-point-indices>>

| 9
| For each of the tie point coordinate and auxillary coordinate variables having a **`bounds`** attribute, add the **`bounds`** attribute to the target coordinate variable and create the target domain bounds variable. For each interpolation zone, apply the interpolation method to reconstitute the target domain bound values and store these in the target domain bound variables. Repeat this step for each combination of indices of the non-interpolation dimensions.

Each recognized coordinate interpolation is described in one of the sections below.
Each section contains: the valid name that is used with the
**`tie_point`** attribute; 



a list of the specific attributes
that may be used to assign values to the mapping's parameters; the
standard names used to identify the coordinate variables that contain
the mapping's independent variables; and references to the mapping's
definition or other information that may help in using the mapping.
Since the attributes used to set a mapping's parameters may be shared
among several mappings, their definitions are contained in a table in
the final section.
The attributes which describe the ellipsoid and prime meridian may be included, when applicable, with any grid mapping.
These are:

- `earth_radius`
- `inverse_flattening`
- `longitude_of_prime_meridian`
- `prime_meridian_name`
- `reference_ellipsoid_name`
- `semi_major_axis`
- `semi_minor_axis`

We have used the FGDC "Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata" <<FGDC>> as a guide in choosing the values for **`grid_mapping_name`** and the attribute names for the parameters describing map projections.
