.Generation of Tie Point Variables and Interpolation Variables
|===============
| Step | Description | Link

| 1
| Identify the coordinate and auxillary coordinate variables for which tie point and interpolation variables are required.
| 

| 2
| Identify non-overlapping subsets of the coordinate variables to be interpolated by the same interpolation method. For each coordinate variable subset, create an interpolation variable and specify the selected interpolation method using the **`interpolation_name`** attribute of the interpolation variable. 
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-interpolation-variable>>

| 3
| For each coordinate variable subset, add the coordinates variable subset and the corresponding interpolation variable to the the **`tie_points`** attribute of the data variable. 
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-points-attribute>>


| 4
| For each coordinate variable subset, identify the set of interpolation and the set of non-interpolation dimensions.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-dimensions>>

| 5
| For each set of the interpolation dimensions, identify the interpolation areas and select the interpolation zones and the tie points, taking into account the required coordinate reconstitution accuracy when selecting the density of tie points.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-points>>

| 6
| For each of the interpolation dimensions, add the interpolation dimension, the corresponding tie point interpolation dimension and, if required by the selected interpolation method, its corresponding interpolation zone dimension to the **`tie_point_dimensions`** attribute of the data variable.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-point-dimensions-attribute>>

| 7
| For each of the interpolation dimensions, record the location of each identified tie point in a tie point index variable. For each interpolation dimension, add the interpolation dimension and its tie point index variable to the **`tie_point_indices`** attribute of the data variable.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-point-indices>>

| 8
| For each of the target coordinate and auxillary coordinate variables, create the corresponding tie point coordinate variable and copy the coordinate values from the target domain coordinate variables to the tie point variables for the target domain indices identified by the tie point index variable. Repeat this step for each combination of indices of the non-interpolation dimensions.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-tie-point-indices>>

| 9
| For each of the target coordinate and auxillary coordinate variable having a **`bounds`** attribute, add the **`bounds`** attribute to the tie point coordinate variable, create the tie point bounds variable and copy the bounds values from the target domain bounds variable to the tie point bounds variable for the target domain indices identified by the tie point index variable. Repeat this step for each combination of indices of the non-interpolation dimensions.
| <<compression-by-coordinate-sampling-bounds>>

| 10
| Finally, if required by the selected interpolation method, follow the steps defined for the method in Appendix J to create any required interpolation coefficients variables and interpolation configuration variables. As relevant, create the  **`interpolation_coefficients`** and **`interpolation_configuration`** attributes and populate them with the interpolation coefficients variables and interpolation configuration variables respectively.

Each recognized coordinate interpolation is described in one of the sections below.
Each section contains: the valid name that is used with the
**`tie_point`** attribute; 



a list of the specific attributes
that may be used to assign values to the mapping's parameters; the
standard names used to identify the coordinate variables that contain
the mapping's independent variables; and references to the mapping's
definition or other information that may help in using the mapping.
Since the attributes used to set a mapping's parameters may be shared
among several mappings, their definitions are contained in a table in
the final section.
The attributes which describe the ellipsoid and prime meridian may be included, when applicable, with any grid mapping.
These are:

- `earth_radius`
- `inverse_flattening`
- `longitude_of_prime_meridian`
- `prime_meridian_name`
- `reference_ellipsoid_name`
- `semi_major_axis`
- `semi_minor_axis`

We have used the FGDC "Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata" <<FGDC>> as a guide in choosing the values for **`grid_mapping_name`** and the attribute names for the parameters describing map projections.
